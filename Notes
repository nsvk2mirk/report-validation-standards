Basics of Validation for Analytics

Scope:

Reporting Tools: Oracle Analytics Cloud, Power BI

Source Systems (OLTP): Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Fusion Cloud

🔧 Technical Validation

These checks ensure the report behaves like a well-trained instrument, not a rogue drummer.

1. Report Navigation

Validate object-to-object navigation paths.

Ensure links, breadcrumbs, menu entries, and dashboard flows lead to the right pages.

Confirm no circular or dead-end navigation loops.

2. Drill Through / Drill Down

Drill Down: Validates hierarchical expansion (e.g., Ledger → Account → Journal → Line).

Drill Through: Confirm passing of parameters to downstream reports.

Ensure filters persist correctly when moving between summary and detail layers.

3. Measure Aggregations

Validate formulas for SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT, DISTINCT COUNT.

Confirm aggregation rules match business logic (e.g., revenue net vs. gross, headcount point-in-time vs. average).

Ensure aggregation behavior is consistent across dashboards, visuals, and exports.

🧭 Functional Validation

These checks verify that the report behaves as users expect, not as developers wish.

1. Responsiveness to Dashboard Prompts / Filters

Validate slicer behavior for multi-select, default values, cascading prompts.

Ensure applying filters updates all dependent visuals and KPIs.

Confirm performance is reasonable under typical filter combinations.

2. Measure Value Validation (Summary vs. Drill Reports)

Verify that totals shown in summary dashboards match the roll-up of drill reports.

Confirm that subtotals obey business hierarchies and time dimensions.

Check Grand Totals vs. SUM of Rows (common trap!).

🧱 Data Integrity Validation

This ensures the report’s story isn’t fiction.

1. Validity of Data Based on Report Definition

Check column-level definitions against business metadata.

Validate joins between subject areas or datasets.

Ensure orphaned records are excluded unless explicitly expected.

Confirm proper handling of nulls, effective dates, primary keys.

🎯 Data Accuracy Validation

This is the final face-off: the report vs. the source (OLTP).

1. Comparison with Source Database

Choose a fixed set of common parameters (e.g., date, BU, ledger, customer, supplier).

Pull the equivalent query directly from EBS/Fusion Cloud tables.

Validate fact values at:

Transaction level

Daily/Monthly summary

Ledger/Balancing segment

Validate dimensional conformance (customer, item, employee, period, account).

2. Edge Cases

Canceled transactions

Backdated entries

Effective-date based changes

Multi-currency conversions

Transaction corrections and reversals
